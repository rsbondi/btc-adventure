# Programming Bitcoin

This folder is my adventure going through the [Programming Bitcoin](https://github.com/jimmysong/programmingbitcoin) by Jimmy Song.  This was created by reading the material there and producing the code in javascript to create the library classes and test code to verify results.

* chapter 1 - the code in its current state appears to work, it uses `big-integer` for the `pow` function, but probably as I progress through the book I will need to refactor all functions to use it, but for now it is easier to illustrate with pure javascript numbers.
* chapter 2 - this isues `big-integer` throughout but not really needed to illustrate, all numbers small enought, numbers returned as js numbers for illustration
