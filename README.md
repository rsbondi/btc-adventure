Sharing my learning experience of the inner workings of bitcoin

This repository is for me to share my learning progress with bitcoin technologies.  
It is not meant to be a definitive guide, but it hopes to be helpful for those who also wish to learn.
The code is not meant to be an example of design architecture, all examples are written for ease of following the specifics of each topic.

Thank you for taking the time to share in the journey with me and I hope you and I can work together on creating a brighter future.
